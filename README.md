**1-14-2015**: Bugfix to have emoticons read correctly after Twitch.tv html was changed <br />
**1-16-2015**: Version 2.0 finished with fixes to general functionality. Script will now load on page ready rather than on opening chat settings. Chatlines are now filtered by showing valid lines rather than hiding invalid lines in order to improve chat readability for channels with high amounts of traffic. </br>
